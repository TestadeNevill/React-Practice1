## Description

I created a simple application that uses Bootstrap and several different React tools such as, functional and class components, states and hooks to generate a list of user names. The list are created by entering them in a input field, once submitted a function enters the data into a list and updates the DOM to display the added names.

## Usage

Once the files are downloaded, right-click on the source folder and select "open in intergated window", then enter npm start to run the application. Once the browser window is open, enter a first name, a last name and birthday then click submit. The names will then be added to the list.
